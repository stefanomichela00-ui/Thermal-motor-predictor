# Thermal-motor-predictor
The goal of this project is to design and test a motor temperature predictor capable of estimating the temperatures of critical magneto-electric components, such as the permanent magnets (PM) and the stator windings, without relying on direct sensors. Direct measurement of these temperatures is often impractical in real-world applications due to limitations in sensor placement, cost, and reliability. However, accurate thermal information is crucial for safe operation, performance optimization, and lifetime estimation of electric machines. To overcome this challenge, the predictor is trained using workbench test data collected from the motor under controlled conditions. In this setup, high-accuracy sensors are used to measure internal temperatures while the motor undergoes a wide range of test cycles that reflect diverse operating scenarios (varying torque, speed, currents, voltages, and cooling conditions). The project follows a data-driven approach where these experimental datasets serve as the foundation for building and validating machine learning models. By learning the complex relationships between measurable external variables (e.g., torque, motor speed, voltages, currents, coolant temperature) and the internal temperatures of critical components, the predictor can provide reliable estimates during real operation—where only external signals are available.

## Motor Thermal Characteristics Dataset
"This dataset contains sensor recordings from a permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) undergoing test bench measurements, collected by the LEA department at Paderborn University. It includes 185 hours of data, expanded from an initial 138 hours, with all data now deanonymised. The motor is a prototype model from a German OEM. The data was gathered by exciting the motor with hand-designed driving cycles that simulate real-world conditions by denoting reference motor speed and torque. This dataset is particularly valuable for developing predictive models for rotor temperature and torque, as these are features that are often difficult and costly to measure reliably in commercial vehicles."
