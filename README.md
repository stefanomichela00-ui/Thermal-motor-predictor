# Thermal-motor-predictor
The goal of this project is to design and test a motor temperature predictor capable of estimating the temperatures of critical magneto-electric components, such as the permanent magnets (PM) and the stator windings, without relying on direct sensors. Direct measurement of these temperatures is often impractical in real-world applications due to limitations in sensor placement, cost, and reliability. However, accurate thermal information is crucial for safe operation, performance optimization, and lifetime estimation of electric machines. To overcome this challenge, the predictor is trained using workbench test data collected from the motor under controlled conditions. In this setup, high-accuracy sensors are used to measure internal temperatures while the motor undergoes a wide range of test cycles that reflect diverse operating scenarios (varying torque, speed, currents, voltages, and cooling conditions). The project follows a data-driven approach where these experimental datasets serve as the foundation for building and validating machine learning models. By learning the complex relationships between measurable external variables (e.g., torque, motor speed, voltages, currents, coolant temperature) and the internal temperatures of critical components, the predictor can provide reliable estimates during real operation—where only external signals are available.
